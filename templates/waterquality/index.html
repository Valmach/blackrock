				Introduction
				</h2>
				
				<p>
				Welcome to the Virtual Forest Initiative's Water Quality Module
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Where's the closest river to you? Have you ever wondered if it has any fish? Are urban rivers safer for aquatic life than streams passing through pristine forests? What makes an aquatic ecosystem suitable for life? You will explore these vital questions in this virtual lab using data obtained by high school students and professional scientists from the NYC area. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Among the most important factors that determine safe living conditions for aerobic (needing oxygen) organisms is dissolved oxygen because it can vary quickly and with significant magnitude, depending on many natural and anthropogenic factors. A sudden loss of oxygen saturation in water will cause massive deaths of most forms of aquatic life. Therefore oxygen has been taken as a measure of the "pulse" of an aquatic ecosystem, more so than pH or even nutrient levels. Why do organisms need oxygen? Recall that oxygen is used during cellular respiration to make ATP for energy. Also recall that oxygen is produced by plants during photosynthesis while capturing the Sun's light energy to make sugar. As you can see oxygen is at the very heart of life. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In order to see how dissolved oxygen can affect a real ecosystem, take the pulse of an urban water way (i.e. Harlem River) to see if living things can survive and then compare your findings with a creek in a forest (i.e. Black Rock Forest). Determine if something as simple as rain can make life for fish impossible in a polluted city. With this virtual lab you will create impressive graphs, use statistics to look for patterns, and create a report that you can give to a government agency to advocate for a better planet.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Here are some guiding questions to keep in mind as you go through these exercises:
				</p>
				
				<ol>
				<li>What makes an aquatic ecosystem suitable for life?</li>
				<li>How can natural events affect the viability of an ecosystem?</li>
				<li>How are anthropogenic factors contributing to the suitability of water ways in harboring life?</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Introduction of Virtual Lab</h3>
				
				<p>
				The Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Virtual Lab is designed to introduce high school students to data analysis and the inter-relationship between water quality parameters and their effects on organisms in the environment. Students get to study a topic of interest that deals with the usability of a body of water for aquatic organism survivorship based on water quality data. Correlations can be made between various parameters and comparisons can be made between urban or natural forest areas.  To this effect, dissolved oxygen data from a water quality station in the Harlem River (HARI) and a stream pool in Black Rock Forest (BRF) will be used together with rain and temperature data from the same areas. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				After reading this introductory material, students will work through a set of questions related to water quality.  In doing so, they will apply simple, yet important, data analysis tools, such as linear regression and t-tests, to help them come up with solutions. Students will then write their own conclusions to the questions and submit them to their teacher.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Students will also be given the option of writing a letter to a local government representative advocating for the environment or act as a consultant to a local commercial establishment.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				By the end of the lab, students should be able to answer the following questions:
				</p>
				
				<ol>
				<li>What affects DO levels more, temperature or rain events?</li>
				<li>Are the DO levels sufficient to allow aquatic organisms to grow in HARI and/or BRF?</li>
				<li>Are the DO levels sufficient to allow aquatic organisms to survive in HARI and/or BRF?</li>
				<li>Do rain events affect the levels of DO in HARI and/or BRF?</li>
				<li>Are there differences in DO levels between HARI and BRF at like water temperatures, ambient temperatures, and/or similar rain events?</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Background</h3>
				
				<h4>Dissolved Oxygen Levels and affects on Aquatic life</h4>
				
				EPA (2000) Ambient Aquatic Life Water Quality Criteria for Dissolved Oxygen 	(Saltwater): Cape cod and Cape Hatterias. Office Of Water. 133p.
				
				Aquatic Ecosystems (n.d.) Dissolved Oxygen in Aquaculture. Accessed: March 14, 2011. http://www.aquaticeco.com/pages/full_width/55/Dissolved-Oxygen-in-Aquaculture
				
				In a pristine forest, rain will not usually force oxygen out of the water as it will in the city. That's because in the city there are the pipes known as CSOs or Combined Sewage Outflows that flood during a heavy storm and force sewage waste out into the rivers. Bacteria thrive when human waste is abundant and they will grow out of proportion until they run out of food and die. This is when a second set of bacteria will consume all the dead organisms while using all the dissolved oxygen in the process. You guessed it, the amount of oxygen will drastically fall and will threaten fish and other aquatic organisms by halting their cellular respiration. 
				
				- Hypoxia is the deficiency of dissolved oxygen. 
				- It can occur naturally as the temperature of water increases. This can be harmful to the organisms.  
				- It can also occur in the presence of oxygen requiring chemical reactions such as nitrification and the abundance on Nitrogen and other such elements.
				- Dissolved oxygen (DO) is important for the overall protection of recruitment, growth, and survival of larva, juveniles, and adult organisms. 
				- Biological Effects of Low Dissolved Oxygen
				- -Oxygen is essential in aerobic organisms for the electron transport system of mitochondria. Oxygen insufficiency at the mitochondria results in reduction in cellular energy and a subsequent loss of ion balance in cellular and circulatory fluids. If oxygen insufficiency persists, death will ultimately occur, although some aerobic animals also possess anaerobic metabolic pathways, which can delay lethality for short time periods (minutes to days). Anaerobiosis is well developed in some benthic animals, such as bivalve molluscs and polychaetes, but not in other groups, like fish and crustaceans (Hammen, 1976). There is no evidence that any free-living animal inhabiting coastal or estuarine waters can live without oxygen indefinitely. Many aquatic animals have adapted to short periods of hypoxia and anaerobiosis by taking up more oxygen and transporting it more effectively to cells and mitochondria, that is, by ventilating its respiratory surfaces more intensely and increasing its heart rate. If 5 these responses are insufficient to maintain the blood's pH, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the respiratory pigment will decrease. An early behavioral response might be moving faster toward better oxygenated water. However, if the hypoxia persists, the animal may reduce its swimming and feeding, which will reduce its need for energy and hence oxygen. Such reduced motor activity may make the animal more tolerant over the short term, but will not solve its long-term problem. For example, even the modest reductions in locomotion required by mild hypoxia may make the animal more vulnerable to predators, and the reduced feeding may decrease its growth. Compensatory adaptations are well developed in marine animals that commonly experience hypoxia, for example, intertidal and tide pool animals (McMahon, 1988) and burrowing animals, which partly explains their reported high tolerance to low DO. In contrast, compensatory adaptations are poorly developed in animals that inhabit well-oxygenated environments such as the upper water column. The animals most sensitive to hypoxia are among this latter group. Details on compensatory adaptations to hypoxia are provided in reviews for marine animals (Vernberg, 1972), aquatic invertebrates (Herreid, 1980), and fish (Holeton, 1980; Hughes, 1981; Kramer, 1987; Rombough, 1988a; Heath, 1995).
				- Dissolved oxygen levels:
				- exceeding 4.8 mg/L is considered safe for growth. 
				- levels between 2.3 to 4.8 mg/L will allow juveniles and adults to survive. DO below 2.3 mg/L is uninhabitable.
				- Air breathing animals are used to air containing about 21 percent oxygen, whereas aquaculture is conducted in water containing less than .0001 percent oxygen (10 mg/L).
				- If the oxygen level is too high, oxygen supersaturation can cause gas embolism, depress metabolism and inhibit respiratory enzymes, all of which can kill fish. If it is too low, the fish may not eat and may expend additional energy seeking oxygen. If lower yet, they can experience severe stress and, of course, death.
				
				
				<h4>Harlem River</h4>
				
				Columbia University (n.d.) History and Significance of the Harlem River.  [bad link]	http://www.gsapp.org/Archive/HP/2003-2004/pdf/history.pdf
				- -The Harlem River forms a part of the Hudson estuary system, serving as a narrow strait that divides the island of Manhattan from the Bronx. The name river is technically incorrect, as the Harlem River has neither a mouth nor a source. It simply connects two larger bodies of water, stretching from the Hudson River to the intersection of the East River at Randall's Island, at approximately East 125th Street on the present street grid. The Harlem River is therefore affected by the actions of the ocean and neighboring rivers. The ebb and flow of the tides causes the Harlem River's currents to fluctuate dramatically throughout the day. The effects of the tides have influenced the spread of silts, pollutants, and other particles in the water. The tides were also important in defining the usage of the Harlem River as they caused the currents to be particularly difficult to navigate in the northern portion of the waterway, allowing only smaller ships and experienced sailors.

				NYSDEC (Feb. 2007) Handbook of Waste Water Management for Local 	Representatives. 	http://nywea.org/_default.inc/content/DECHandbook/DECHandbk(1-27-07).pdf 	148p.
				
				- Waste water from run-off can have oxidizable chemicals such as Nitrogen and Phosphorus that will use up oxygen very quickly. Because natural water ways contain bacteria and nutrients any waste water introduced into them will initiate biochemical reactions that will decrease the amount of oxygen in the water. This can lead to "fish kills" and effects on aquatic life not to mention waterbourne diseases.
				- According to EPA's Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Program (BEACH Program), stormwater was the cause of 21 percent of all swimming beach advisories and closings nationally during the 2002 swimming season.
				- A mix of pollutants, including bacteria, metals, nutrients, oil, grease, pesticides and sediment, are carried into our waterways by the large volumes of stormwater that wash across construction sites and urban areas.

				<h3>-04. What are CSO's?</h3>
				
				EPA (2011) Combined Sewer Overflows. Last updated: Jan. 04, 2011. 	http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/home.cfm?program_id=5
				
				Combined sewer systems are sewers that are designed to collect rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater in the same pipe. Most of the time, combined sewer systems transport all of their wastewater to a sewage treatment plant, where it is treated and then discharged to a water body. During periods of heavy rainfall or snowmelt, however, the wastewater volume in a combined sewer system can exceed the capacity of the sewer system or treatment plant. For this reason, combined sewer systems are designed to overflow occasionally and discharge excess wastewater directly to nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies.

				<h3>-05. What is nitrification?</h3>
				
				EPA (August 15, 2002) Nitrification. http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/disinfection/tcr/pdfs/whitepaper_tcr_nitrification.	pdf 	17p.
				
				- Nitrification is a microbial process by which reduced nitrogen compounds (primarily ammonia) are sequentially oxidized to nitrite and nitrate. Ammonia is present in drinking water through either naturally-occurring processes or through ammonia addition during secondary disinfection to form chloramines. The nitrification process is primarily accomplished by two groups of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria that can build organic molecules using energy obtained from inorganic sources, in this case ammonia or nitrite. 
				- Nitrification can have the adverse impacts of increasing nitrite and nitrate levels, reducing alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and chloramine residuals, and promoting bacterial regrowth (Wilczak et al. 1996).

				<h3>-07. How can linear regression and correlation help look for relationships among variables?</h3>
				
				Stats Direct (2009) Regression and Correlation. Date Accessed 03.14.11. http://www.ukph.org/help/regression_and_correlation/rcr.htm
				
				Correlation refers to the interdependence or co-relationship of variables. (Hint: This can help when you're looking for the relationship between 2 parameters.)
				
				In the context of regression examples, correlation reflects the closeness of the linear relationship between x and Y. Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient rho is a measure of this linear relationship. Rho is referred to as R when it is estimated from a sample of data.
				
				* R lies between -1 and 1 with
				* R = 0 is no linear correlation
				* R = 1 is perfect positive (slope up from bottom left to top right) linear correlation
				* R = -1 is perfect negative (slope down from top left to bottom right) linear correlation
				
				Assumption of Pearson's correlation:
				* at least one variable must follow a normal distribution
				
				
				N.B. If R is close to - 1 then this does NOT mean that there is a good causal relationship between x and Y. It shows only that the sample data is close to a straight line. R is a much abused statistic.
				
				
				r? is the proportion of the total variance (s?) of Y that can be explained by the linear regression of Y on x. 1-r? is the proportion that is not explained by the regression. Thus 1-r? = s?xY / s?Y.

				08. What is a t-test?<h3>
				</h3>
				http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/stat_t.php
				
				The t-test is a data analysis procedure that assesses whether the means of two groups are statistically different from each other. (This statistics method can be used to when comparing two different stations with each other.)

				Description of Cascade Brook:
				A simple, first-order headwater stream, arising from groundwater and precipitation. Drains a 300-acre forested watershed with no human developments aside from one gravel road. No sources of pollution aside from atmospheric deposition. All stream water runs over a granite outcrop at the base of the watershed where a stream station was installed in 2000 to quantify streamflow and water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and acidity (pH). The stream eventually empties into the Hudson River.
				
				Aquatic Life in Cascade Brook region:  
				Aome algae and aquatic plants, various invertebrates, list of fish, reptiles and amphibians.
				
				Weather station metadata Harlem
				
				TBD
